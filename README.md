# GODAP: The Data Analysis Pipeline 
(a port of the ruby-based DAP: https://github.com/rapid7/dap)

DAP was created to transform text-based data on the command-line, specializing in transforms that are annoying or difficult to do with existing tools.

DAP reads data using an input plugin, transforms it through a series of filters, and prints it out again using an output plugin. Every record is treated as a document (aka: hash/dict) and filters are used to reduce, expand, and transform these documents as they pass through. Think of DAP as a mashup between sed, awk, grep, csvtool, and jq, with map/reduce capabilities.

DAP was written to process terabyte-sized public scan datasets, such as those provided by https://scans.io/. This go version of dap supports parallel processing of data. Results are forwarded to stdout and consistency of ordering is not guaranteed (and are highly likely to be out of order when compared to the input data stream).

## Usage

### Quick Setup for GeoIP Lookups

Note: The documentation below assumes you've properly setup $GOPATH and $PATH (usually $GOPATH/bin:$PATH) per the official golang documentation.

```
$ go get github.com/rapid7/godap
$ sudo bash
# mkdir -p /var/lib/geoip && cd /var/lib/geoip && wget http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLiteCity.dat.gz && gunzip GeoLiteCity.dat.gz && mv GeoLiteCity.dat geoip.dat
```

```
$  echo 8.8.8.8 | godap lines + geo_ip line + json
{"line":"8.8.8.8","line.country_code":"US","line.country_code3":"USA","line.country_name":"United States","line.latitude":"38.0","line.longitude":"-97.0"}
```

Where dap gets fun is doing transforms, like just grabbing the country code:
```
$  echo 8.8.8.8 | godap lines + geo_ip line + select line.country_code3 + lines
USA
```

## Inputs, filters and outputs
The general syntax when calling godap is ```godap <input> + (<filter +> <filter +> <filter +> ...) + <output>```, where input, filter and output correspond to one of the supported features below. Filters are optional, though an input and output are required. Each feature component is separated by ```+```. Component options are specified immediately after the component declaration. For example, streaming from a wifi adapter and spitting out json documents would resemble: ```godap pcap iface=en0 rfmon=true + json```. Component options with spaces or other complexities can be specified using shell-like quoting. For example, for a bpf pcap filter on the pcap component: ```godap pcap iface=en0 'filter="tcp port 80"' + json```.

## Inputs

 * pcap
   
  Specifies that the input stream is a packet capture. Currently supports streaming in from a file or interface.

  | Option  | Description                                                                           | Value               | Default |
  |---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------|
  | iface   | The interface to read packets from. If iface is specified, file must not be specified | string interface id | ```<none>```    |
  | file    | The pcap file to read from. If file is specified, iface must not be specified         | string filename     | ```<none>```    |
  | promisc | Whether to capture in promiscuous mode                                                | boolean             | false   |
  | timeout | The capture timeout                                                                   | integer             | -1 (inf)|
  | snaplen | The snap length                                                                       | integer             | 65536   |
  | rfmon   | Whether to capture in monitor mode (applicable only to adapters which support it)     | boolean             | false   |
  
  Example:
  * Pull packets in from monitor mode: ```godap pcap iface=en0 rfmon=true + json```
  * Read pcap (or pcap-ng) file contents and convert to json: ```godap pcap file=foo.pcap + json```
  * Live capture in promiscuous mode: ```godap pcap iface=en0 promisc=true + json```

 * json
 
  Specifies that the input stream is represented as JSON data.
  
  | Option  | Description                                                                           | Value               | Default |
  |---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------|
  | file    | The file to stream from. If not specified, stdin is assumed. Can also be - for stdin. | string filename     | stdin   |
  
  Example:
   ```
echo '{"a":2}' | godap json + lines
2
   ```

 * lines

  Specifies that the input stream is represented as newline-terminated plaintext.
  
  | Option  | Description                                                                           | Value               | Default |
  |---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------|
  | file    | The file to stream from. If not specified, stdin is assumed. Can also be - for stdin. | string filename     | stdin   |

  Example:
   ```
echo hello world | godap lines + json
{"line":"hello world"}
   ```
## Filters

 * rename
  
  Renames a document field.

  | Option               | Description                | Value                          | Default |
  |----------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------|---------|
